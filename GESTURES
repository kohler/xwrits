Here is a list of the non-American obscene hand gestures that people have
told me about. I haven't drawn them all yet.

Do you know any obscene hand gestures not described in this file? Please
email them to me at <eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu>!

"ARAB CULTURE"

If the finger goes forward instead of up it is equally offensive in Arab
culture.  I hpe it adds to your collection of cultural offensive
behavior

ENGLAND

make a victory sign (v) with palms facing yourself and back of hand
toward victim.  It means the same as the bird in England.

I was told by a friend in England (alot of English don't even know this!)
of the origins of the peace-sign, with the back of the hand facing the
person being flipped-off. She told me that in the earlier part of the
millenium, when England and France were frequently at battle, the French
would cut-off the fingers (necessary for shooting an arrow) from the
archers, they had taken as prisoner. After this became known to the english
archers, they would flash this gesture to the French in the battle-field,
thus telling them that they still had their fingers and could still cause
some damage in battle. At the moment, I'm trying to find documentation on
this, but I saw your page and thought I might as well share the story.

I just noticed that you're looking for rude gestures from other
cultures.  Appropriate to your current surroundings, I believe that a
"peace" symbol (I think with the back of the hand facing forward) is
rude in England.  Last time I flew over, a guy asked for two drinks,
and made that sign.  The stewardess warned him about possible
misunderstanding.

If you make the "V for victory" sign, such that the curled fingers
are facing towards you, (the backs of the two fingers are facing the
person) this gesture is offensive in England.

There was an article in a magazine about such gestures, but I don't
know where it is any more.  I think the "OK" symbol is offensive
in some parts of the world, actually.

ITALY

In Italy, a reverse V sign, with knuckles facing the 
viewer, also means fuck you. A variation of this 
gesture is to insert your nose at the crotch of the V.
The "variation" is perhaps the original gesture. I
gather that the nose is supposed to be a penis and
the V a woman's private parts.
Or rather spread legs.

IRAN

Some gestures I have found are the "thumbs-up" which is obscene in Iran. It
literally means "go screw yourself".

JAPAN

In Japan, inserting the thumb between the first two 
fingers, in imitation of the clitoris, means something
like fuck you.

KOREA

If you're in Korea (or around Koreans), NEVER play "got your nose" with
little kids: If you make a fist and put your thumb between your index
finger and middle finger, you're essentially saying "fuck you." I've
also been told, but have not really verified that if you stick your
thumb between your middle finger and ring finger you're essentially
saying "fuck you in the ass."

Rude enough?

UNKNOWN/UNSURE

I'm not sure which country the following gesture comes from, but my
guess is somewhere in Africa or middle-east, correct me if I'm wrong. I
heard this from a "User Interfaces" course lecturer. Ok, the gesture:
If you casually raise your hand meaning to say 'hi' with your open palm
facing another person, it means 'I throw dirt on your face'. I hear this
is a rather harsh insult. Comparable to 'fuck you' or even worse.

I recall that some version of MSWindows has this gesture as a "stop" or
"attention" sign. Wonder what they might think of it... :)
