Version 2.6b7

* Clock improvements: fixed problem with black-on-black clock on 24-plane
  displays (it had to do with visual selection: WhitePixel wasn't white since
  the Visual was not the default). Also improved clock appearance and made it
  appear more like when it's supposed to.


Version 2.6b6

* Improved the configure script to use <sys/types.h> for u_int32_t, etc.
  when possible.

* Fixed bug in gifx.c: on a 24-plane display, any picture came out all black.
  (The problem: implementation-specific behavior of <<; specifically,
  I expected 1<<32 == 0 for 32-bit ints.)

* Added visual searching: xwrits will now use a TrueColor visual if available.


Version 2.6b4

* Updated GIF library to 0.9, the version used in Gifsicle. This has
  temporarily broken support for monochrome displays, but will hopefully
  fix other bugs some people have experienced.


Version 2.6b3

* Fixed installation and improved the configure script.


Version 2.6b2

* Fixed bug with freeing memory multiple times. Works better on Linux now.
