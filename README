XWRITS VERSION 2.6
==================

ABOUT XWRITS
------------
Xwrits was written when my wrists really hurt. They don't any more --
most of the time.

Please see the man page (xwrits.man) for more information.

MAKING XWRITS
-------------
All you need is an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc, and X11R4/5/(6?) libraries
and includes.

Just type ./configure, then make. You can no longer build xwrits using imake.

If configure cannot find your X includes and libraries, you need to
tell it where they are. You do this with the --x-includes=DIRECTORY
and --x-libraries=DIRECTORY options. For instance, on a certain
machine at MIT, I need to say
% ./configure --x-includes=/mit/x11/include --x-libraries=/mit/x11/decmipslib

If configure cannot find your C compiler, set the CC environment variable to
the right compiler before running configure.

before doing so. My email address is eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu. I'd also
appreciate being informed of any neat changes or bug fixes anyone
makes.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1
---------------------- 
Many, many more options have been added. The code has been cleaned up
a great deal, and also expanded a great deal. Comments should still be
added to the code.

Xwrits no longer uses XPM files. Instead, it uses GIF files, with some
proprietary extensions. The GIF files are compiled into C files, then
object files, and read from memory. This makes xwrits a much, much
smaller executable, faster, and more portable.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2
----------------------
The most important change is the +idle option, on by default, which makes
xwrits slightly smarter than an alarm clock. The code has also been completely
reorganized around the Alarm concept, which makes it much cleaner.

Now that I am in grad school I can stick stuff on an FTP server. So uudecode
is gone.

BUGS, SUGGESTIONS, ETC.

Please write me if you have trouble building or running xwrits, or if you have
any suggestions. Again that email address is: eddietwo@lcs.mit.edu
