XWRITS VERSION 2.24
===================

ABOUT XWRITS
------------
   Xwrits was written when my wrists really hurt. They don't any more --
most of the time.

   Please see the man page (xwrits.1) for more information. The man page is
on the Web at <http://www.lcdf.org/xwrits/man.html>.

MAKING XWRITS
-------------
   All you need is an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc, and X11R4/5/6 libraries
and includes.

   Just type `./configure', then `make'.

   If `./configure' can't find your X includes and libraries, you need to
tell it where they are. You do this with the `--x-includes=DIRECTORY' and
`--x-libraries=DIRECTORY' options.

   If `./configure' can't find your C compiler, set the CC environment
variable to the right compiler before running configure.

   `./configure' accepts the usual options. See `INSTALL' for more
details.
