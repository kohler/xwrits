- Xwrits should optionally log to a file the number of keystrokes made each
  time period, and optionally some other statistics. Suggested by Miernik
  <miernik@ctnet.pl>.

- I just started using xwrits at work, and I realized that when
xwrits locks my screen is a good time to go elsewhere and do
something else.

To do that, though, I have to first unlock xwrits, and then lock
my screen.  It would be cool if I could type something into xwrits
that would cause it to run a command I set up in advance (e.g.,
``xscreensaver-command -lock''). [C. M. Connelly]
