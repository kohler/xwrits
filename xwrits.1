.TH XWRITS 1 "9 Aug 1999" "Version \*V"
.SH NAME
xwrits \- reminds you to take wrist breaks
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xwrits
\%[\-display \fIdisplay\fP]
\%[typetime=\fItime\fP]
\%[breaktime=\fItime\fP]
\%[other options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBXwrits\fP reminds you to take wrist breaks for prevention or management
of repetitive stress injuries. When you should take a break, it pops up an
X window, the warning window. You click on the warning window, then take a
break. The window changes appearance while you take the break. It changes
again when your break is over. Then you just resume typing. \fBXwrits\fP
hides itself until you should take another break.
.PP
The \fBtypetime\fP option changes the amount of time between breaks, and
the \fBbreaktime\fP option changes the length of a break. The defaults are
55 minutes and 5 minutes, respectively.
.PP
\fBXwrits\fP's graphics are brightly colored pictures of a wrist and hand.
The hand clenches and spreads ``as if in pain'' on the warning window,
slumps relaxed during the break, and points forward valiantly when the
break is over. It is trapped behind bars while the keyboard is locked.
Other gestures are included (see the \fB+finger\fP option). You can also
use your own pictures: see the \fBwarning-picture\fP, \fBrest-picture\fP,
and \fBready-picture\fP options.
.PP
\fBXwrits\fP normally works through annoyance\*Eit flashes until you stop
typing. However, an option makes it actively prevent you from typing by
locking the screen. See \fB+lock\fP below.
.PP
\fBXwrits\fP monitors your typing and notices when you leave your
workstation idle or cheat on a break; you can turn this off with the
\fB-idle\fP option. With the \fB+mouse\fP option, it will also monitor your
mouse movements\*Eyou won't be able to move the mouse during a break
without aborting the break.
'
.SH ESCALATION
It is easy to put the warning window aside ``for 5 minutes'' and
ignore it for fifty. Xwrits can escalate its activity over time,
making it harder to ignore.
.PP
This is done with the \fBafter\fP=\fIdelay-time\fP option. All options
following \fBafter\fP only apply after you have ignored the warning window
for \fIdelay-time\fP. In other words, xwrits's behavior escalates after
\fIdelay-time\fP. For instance, with this command line,
.nf
	xwrits flashtime=:2 after=10 flashtime=:.03
.fi
the warning window will begin flashing very quickly if it is ignored
for 10 minutes.
.PP
Any options specified preceding an \fBafter\fP option also apply
following it. You may explicitly cancel such options, however. For
example:
.nf
	xwrits +finger after=10 -finger
.fi
.PP
You may have more than one \fBafter\fP option. This creates a series
of escalations.
'
.SH OPTIONS
All options may be abbreviated to their unique prefixes. Some may be
abbreviated further, in which case the smallest legal abbreviation is shown
in brackets. Options are processed from left to right.
.PP
Options listed as ``\fB+option\fP (\fB\-option\fP)'' are toggles, which can
be on or off. A + turns the option on; \- turns it off. Off is the default
for most toggle options, and only the on behavior is described. You can
leave off the + sign if you like: ``xwrits +finger'' and ``xwrits finger''
are equivalent.
.PP
Many options take arguments. You can give these after an equal sign, as in
``xwrits breaktime=2''. Non-optional arguments can also be given
separately, as in ``xwrits breaktime 2''.
.PP
Time arguments are expressed in minutes. For example, ``2'' is 2 minutes,
``2.5'' is 2 minutes 30 seconds. A colon can be used to specify seconds as
well: ``2:05.4'' is 2 minutes 5.4 seconds, and ``:5'' is 5 seconds.

.TP 5
\fB\-display\fP \fIdisplay\fP
Which display to run on.
'
.TP 5
\fBtypetime\fP=\fItime\fP [\fBt\fP]
The amount of time between breaks. Default is 55 minutes.
'
.TP 5
\fBbreaktime\fP=\fItime\fP [\fBb\fP]
The amount of time a break lasts. Default is 5 minutes.
'
.TP 5
\fBafter\fP=\fIdelay-time\fP
See
.SB ESCALATION
above.
'
.TP 5
\fB+beep\fP (\fB\-beep\fP)
Xwrits will beep when the break should begin and again when it is
over.
'
.TP 5
\fB+breakclock\fP (\fB\-breakclock\fP) [\fBbc\fP]
A clock will appear in the resting window showing how many minutes
remain in the wrist break.
'
.TP 5
\fB+cheat\fP[=\fInum\fP] (\fB\-cheat\fP)
Allows you to cheat during a break. You can type \fInum\fP keystrokes
before xwrits cancels the break. Default for \fInum\fP is 5. (If you're
using \fB+mouse\fP, mouse movements also count.)
'
.TP 5
\fB+clock\fP (\fB\-clock\fP) [\fBc\fP]
A clock will appear in the warning window showing how many minutes
you've put off the wrist break.
'
.TP 5
\fB+finger\fP (\fB\-finger\fP) [\fBf\fP]
The warning window will be rude to you.
'
.TP 5
\fB+finger\fP=\fIculture\fP
The warning window will be rude to you, according to \fIculture\fP's idea
of rudeness. Possible values for \fIculture\fP are `american' (the default)
and `korean'.
'
.TP 5
\fBflashtime\fP=\fItime\fP
The amount of time between flashes of the warning window. Default is 2
seconds.
'
.TP 5
\fB+flipoff\fP (\fB\-flipoff\fP)
Synonym for \fB+finger\fP.
'
.TP 5
\fB+iconified\fP (\fB\-iconified\fP)
The warning window will initially appear as an icon.
'
.TP 5
\fB+idle\fP[=\fIcheck-time\fP] (\fB\-idle\fP) [\fBi\fP]
'
When idle is on, xwrits will monitor your typing and adjust its actions
accordingly. For instance, the warning window will not appear if you leave
your workstation unattended. Also, if you stop typing while a warning
window is active, but forget to click the warning window, xwrits will
automatically start your wrist break after waiting for a while. You can set
this waiting time with the optional \fIcheck-time\fP argument; by default,
it's a third of the break's length. \fBidle\fP is on by default.
'
.TP 5
\fB+lock\fP[=\fIjump-time\fP] (\fB\-lock\fP)
Xwrits will lock your screen until your break is
over. You can prematurely disable the lock and get a normal warning
window by typing your password (see \fBpassword\fP below). The
\fIjump-time\fP argument specifies how fast the screensaver will move;
default is 4 seconds. If the keyboard has been grabbed by another
application when the lock is attempted, the lock will fail and a
normal warning window will appear instead.
'
.TP 5
\fBmaxhands\fP=\fInum\fP
No more than \fInum\fP warning windows will appear on your screen
simultaneously. Normally, there will be only one warning window, but
see \fB+multiply\fP below. \fINum\fP cannot be less than 1, or more
than 137. Default is 25.
'
.TP 5
\fBmono\fP (\fB\-mono\fP)
Xwrits will display its graphics in black and white. This may be useful if
you live in a world with a limited colormap.
'
.TP 5
\fB+mouse\fP[=\fIsensitivity\fP] (\fB\-mouse\fP)
Xwrits will monitor your mouse movements. Every couple seconds, it checks
whether the mouse has moved. Movements of more than \fIsensitivity\fP
pixels in any direction are treated like key presses. Default for
\fIsensitivity\fP is 15 pixels.
'
.TP 5
\fB+multiply\fP[=\fIbreed-time\fP] (\fB\-multiply\fP) [\fBm\fP]
A new warning window will be created every \fIbreed-time\fP. Default for
\fIbreed-time\fP is 2.3 seconds.
'
.TP 5
\fB+noiconify\fP (\fB\-noiconify\fP)
The warning window will not allow itself to be iconified.
'
.TP 5
\fBpassword\fP=\fIpassword\fP
The password you type to unlock a locked screen (see \fB+lock\fP above).
Xwrits does not protect this password from intruders.
Therefore, do not use your login password or any other password you must
keep secure. Default is ``quit''.
'
.TP 5
\fBready-picture\fP=\fIfile\fP [\fBokp\fP=\fIfile\fP]
Sets the image that appears when your break is over to an arbitrary GIF.
Animations are acceptable.
'
.TP 5
\fBrest-picture\fP=\fIfile\fP [\fBrp\fP=\fIfile\fP]
Sets the image that appears during your break to an arbitrary GIF.
Animations are acceptable.
'
.TP 5
\fB+top\fP (\fB\-top\fP)
The warning window will try to keep itself above all other windows on the
desktop. (Note: it can be fooled into staying only partially visible.)
'
.TP 5
\fBwarning-picture\fP=\fIfile\fP [\fBwp\fP=\fIfile\fP]
Sets the image that appears on the warning window to an arbitrary GIF.
Animations are acceptable.
'
.TP 5
\fBversion\fP
Prints the version number and some quickie warranty information and exits.
'
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is the way I run xwrits:
.nf
	xwrits typetime=40 finger after 15 clock multiply=5:1.4
.fi
This looks pretty spectacular:
.nf
	xwrits t=0 b=:2 f fla=:.5 m=:.31 max=100 -i
.fi
Whee!!

'
.SH BUGS
Xwrits does not use the X resource database at all.
.PP
More options might be nice. So might more careful screen locking and
password protection. I would like to include rude finger gestures from
other cultures (see the GESTURES file in the distribution for gestures I
know about so far).
.PP
Please send any bugs, comments, or suggestions to me.
.PP
Yes the misspelling is intentional.
.PP
Yes it's my left wrist.
